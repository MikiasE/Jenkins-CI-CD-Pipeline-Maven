# Jenkins-CI-CD-Pipeline-Maven

Included Technologies: EC2, Maven, Jenkins

Languages: Java

This project demonstrates the process to configure a Jenkins continuous integration server on Amazon EC2. Once configured, Jenkins will be set up to build a Java projet with Maven, pulling the project from GitHub automatically, each time a change is pushed to a GitHub repository. Also, line coverage reports will be generated on project unit tests using junit and jacoco plugins.
